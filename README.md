# Linux Discord
A bot that causes chaos by letting Discord users use a bash prompt via Discord.


## Why?
Good Question. This is a project that was once described.... yeah. It was once described.

## Installation
To be able to use this, you need to create a bot, this can be done at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers). Additionally you need Python (obviously) and `python-dotenv` installed. Then you can run `python3 linuxdiscord.py` and let chaos ensue.
